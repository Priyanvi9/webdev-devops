classes are the blueprint for creating objects
class 
    properties-variables
    methods-functions{}
objects
class   
    constructor(arguments){}
    functions{}
objects -> const objectName = new className(arguments)

objects - > key-value pairs - > let userInfo = {
                                            name:"Priyanvi",
                                            age:19,
                                            function()
                                        }
constructor used to initialise the properties of the object,automatically called whenever we attached the NEW keyword for creating instance of a class or object of a class,implicitly called/automatically called.

represents a eventual completion or failure of an async operation and its resultinng value
two approach - call back based approach and promise based approach
