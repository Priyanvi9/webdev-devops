## About This Repository

This repository documents my ongoing learning journey in **Web Development** and **DevOps**. Here, I create small projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while also noting down important concepts I learn daily in simple text files.

The primary goal of this repository is to keep my knowledge organized and to track my progress. Think of it as a live notebook, where each commit represents a new lesson or project completed.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

  * **`/projects`**: This folder contains all the small projects and code exercises I've built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each project resides in its own dedicated sub-folder.
  * **`/notes-txt`**: In this folder, you'll find my daily notes. I use simple `.txt` files to save key points, commands, and concepts related to both Web Development and DevOps.

## What You Can Find Here

  * **Small Web Projects**: Mini-projects like landing pages, calculators, to-do lists, and more.
  * **Code Snippets**: Small pieces of code written to understand specific concepts like Flexbox, Grid, or DOM Manipulation.
  * **Daily Notes**: My personal notes on various DevOps concepts, including Git, Linux, Docker, and cloud services like AWS.

## How to Explore

Feel free to browse through the folders to check out any project or note. You can open the HTML files of the projects directly in your browser to see them in action.
