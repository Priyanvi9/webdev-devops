casting/parsing it into int

when the code begins to run , the only run agent goes from line to line in the ORDER it which written- thread wise - synchronous javascript code

I/O heavy operations - task in computer program that involves a lot of data transfer b/w the program and external system or devices.These operation - reading a file, starting a clock, HTTP request
reading a File var a = readFile(a.text)
starting a Clock - var a = wait(1)
HTTP request - request goes to server and then server respond to us

fs - file system - external library - nodejs fie system modules
require - stmt to import/export external/internal modules 
const fs = require("fs"); // fs is a variable name and fs inside quotes is library both name can be diff as well as same
utf-8 is encoding 
read file sync- read file synchronously
read file - read file asynchronously - use this 
functional arguments = passing a function to another function as an arguments 
call back - example I've started washing machine for laundry, clothes washed machine call back me that the cloth has washed
together all work is doing - asynchronously javascript - readFile
function readFile(err,data){
    if(err){
        console.log("There is an error);
    }
    else{
        console.log(data);
    }
}
setTimeOut(function,time) - time is in millisec/sec- first arguments - callback, second argument - delay
cpu intensive task done/printed first although the i/o task has been done it stay in a Callback queue
concurrency is not parallelism
